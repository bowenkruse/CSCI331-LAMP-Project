            <p>$clubstr is a simple web application built off of the LAMP stack to demonstrate some key web development concepts. While completing this assignment I added a shared image vault page that uses a showFiles() function in functions.php. The CSS is an exiting combination of arcade like color schemes, shapes, all within a brandnew layout. As you log in, note the use of the classic arcade shaped button instead of those ugly href hyperlinks.</p>
